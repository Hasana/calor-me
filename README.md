Calor-me
============

This is a Web application to track an individual's calorie consumption and
expenditure. It has been created as an example HTML5 application for the [SOI
HTML5 Workshop series](http://www.soi.wide.ad.jp/class/cgi/class_top_soiasia2005.cgi?20120002).

The intention is to progressively add to the application throughout the
workshops. For now, anyway, it's *far from complete*.
